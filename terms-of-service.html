    <div class="prose">

      <div class="info-box">
        <strong>Please read these Terms carefully.</strong> By using Grapjes Maker you agree to
        be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.
      </div>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or otherwise using the Grapjes Maker website and associated services
        (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Service
        ("Terms"). These Terms constitute a binding agreement between you and Grapjes Maker
        ("we", "us", or "our"), operated under the laws of <strong>The Netherlands</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are under the age of 13, you may not use the Service. If you are between 13 and
        18 years of age, you may only use the Service with the consent of a parent or legal guardian
        who also agrees to these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Description of the Service</h2>
      <p>
        Grapjes Maker is a joke-generation and content-sharing service. The Service allows users to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Browse, generate, and customise jokes across various categories</li>
        <li>Create joke-based content for sharing on social media</li>
        <li>Connect social media platform accounts and publish content directly to those platforms</li>
        <li>Manage connected platform authorisations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time,
        with or without notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some joke content offered by the Service may be generated automatically using computational
        methods. We do not guarantee the accuracy, originality, or appropriateness of automatically
        generated content. You are responsible for reviewing any content before publishing it to a
        third-party platform.
      </p>

      <h2>3. User Accounts &amp; Platform Connections</h2>
      <p>
        Some features of the Service require you to authenticate using a third-party social media
        account (such as TikTok, or other platforms we may support in the future). You are
        responsible for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keeping your platform credentials confidential</li>
        <li>All activity that occurs via platform authorisations you have granted to the Service</li>
        <li>Notifying us immediately at <a href="mailto:tempcenter@gmail.com">tempcenter@gmail.com</a> if you suspect unauthorised use</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. User Obligations &amp; Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>When using the Service you agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Comply with all applicable Dutch and EU laws and regulations</li>
        <li>Use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms</li>
        <li>Not upload, post, or share content that is unlawful, defamatory, obscene, discriminatory, harassing, or infringing on third-party rights</li>
        <li>Not attempt to gain unauthorised access to any part of the Service or its infrastructure</li>
        <li>Not use automated scripts, bots, or scrapers on the Service without prior written consent</li>
        <li>Not interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service</li>
        <li>Not impersonate any person or entity</li>
        <li>Not use the Service to distribute spam, malware, or phishing content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to restrict access for users who violate these rules.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Platform Services</h2>
      <p>
        Grapjes Maker may integrate with independent third-party social media platforms
        (such as TikTok, and potentially others in the future) via their official developer APIs.
        By connecting a platform account, you acknowledge and agree that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your use of each platform is subject to that platform's own <strong>Terms of Service</strong> and <strong>Community Guidelines</strong>, which you must read and comply with independently of these Terms.</li>
        <li>We are not responsible for any third-party platform's services, availability, content policies, or enforcement decisions.</li>
        <li>A platform may change or restrict its API at any time, which may affect the availability of related features within the Service.</li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for the content you publish to any platform via the Service and for ensuring it complies with that platform's rules.</li>
        <li>You may revoke the Service's access to any connected platform account at any time via that platform's own account settings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For full details of what data is accessed when you connect a platform account, see our
        <a href="privacy-policy.html#api-scopes">Privacy Policy §3 (Third-Party Platform Integrations &amp; API Scopes)</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All intellectual property rights in the Service — including the design, graphics, code,
        branding, and content created by us — are owned by or licensed to Grapjes Maker and protected
        under Dutch and international copyright law.
      </p>
      <p>
        You retain all rights to original content you create using the Service. By publishing
        content to a third-party platform through the Service, you grant that platform the licences
        described in its own Terms of Service; you do not grant Grapjes Maker any additional licence
        beyond what is strictly necessary to provide the publishing functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or exploit any part of the Service without our
        prior written consent.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided on an <strong>"AS IS"</strong> and <strong>"AS AVAILABLE"</strong>
        basis, without any warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited
        to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of viruses or
        other harmful components. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any
        joke content generated by the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by Dutch law, we disclaim all liability for any loss or damage
        arising from your use of, or inability to use, the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the AS IS disclaimer does not exclude any implied warranty of
        conformity that cannot lawfully be waived under Dutch law (Burgerlijk Wetboek Art. 7:17).
        In particular, the core functionality of publishing content to connected platform accounts
        carries an implied obligation to operate as described in these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Dutch law, Grapjes Maker and its operators shall
        not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including
        but not limited to loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your use of or inability to use the Service</li>
        <li>Any content posted or shared via the Service</li>
        <li>Unauthorised access to or alteration of your data</li>
        <li>Actions or inactions of any third-party platform or service provider</li>
        <li>Any other matter relating to the Service</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where liability cannot be fully excluded by law (including under mandatory Dutch consumer
        protection provisions), our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the
        12 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or €50, whichever is greater.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GDPR compensation:</strong> Nothing in this Section limits your right to seek
        compensation under GDPR Art. 82 for material or non-material damage resulting from an
        infringement of the GDPR by us as data controller or processor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in these Terms limits any mandatory right you have under Dutch or EU consumer
        protection law that cannot lawfully be excluded or restricted by contract.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Grapjes Maker and its operators from any claims,
        damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising
        out of your violation of these Terms, your use of the Service, or your infringement of any
        third-party rights.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service, including if we reasonably believe
        you have violated these Terms. Where reasonably practicable, we will provide you with advance
        notice and a brief description of the reason before termination takes effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may stop using the Service at any time and revoke any connected platform authorisations
        from within the respective platform's settings. Upon termination, sections that by their
        nature should survive (including Intellectual Property, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability,
        and Governing Law) will continue to apply.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Your use of the Service is also governed by our
        <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated into these Terms by
        reference. Please review it carefully.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last Updated"
        date above. For material changes, we will provide at least 14 days' advance notice by
        displaying a prominent notice on the Service. Continued use of the Service after changes
        take effect constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Complaints, Governing Law &amp; Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Complaints first:</strong> Before initiating any legal proceedings, we invite you
        to contact us at <a href="mailto:tempcenter@gmail.com">tempcenter@gmail.com</a> describing
        your complaint. We will respond within 14 days with a proposed resolution. Using this
        pathway is optional and does not limit your right to bring a claim at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms and any disputes arising from them are governed exclusively by the laws of
        <strong>The Netherlands</strong>, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. You agree to
        submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts located in <strong>The Netherlands</strong>
        for any dispute arising under or relating to these Terms or the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a consumer resident in the EU, you may also be entitled to use the European
        Commission's Online Dispute Resolution platform at
        <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Force Majeure</h2>
      <p>
        We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in providing the Service, or any feature
        that depends on a third-party platform API, where such failure or delay results from
        circumstances outside our reasonable control. These include, without limitation: third-party
        platform API changes, restrictions, or unavailability; internet or telecommunications
        outages; governmental or regulatory actions; or other events of force majeure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where a material platform feature becomes unavailable for an extended period, we will notify
        affected users as soon as reasonably practicable via the Service or by email.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Severability</h2>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
        competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
        The invalid provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.
      </p>

      <h2>16. Entire Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you
        and Grapjes Maker with respect to the Service and supersede all prior agreements,
        representations, or understandings.
      </p>
