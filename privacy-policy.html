        <strong>Summary:</strong> Grapjes Maker collects only the minimum data needed to operate
        its features. We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties for marketing
        purposes. Data obtained from third-party platforms is used solely to provide the
        Service's core functionality.
      </div>

      <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Grapjes Maker ("we", "us", or "our") is a service operated under Dutch law. If you have
        any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:tempcenter@gmail.com">tempcenter@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Scope of This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Grapjes Maker website and associated
        services (collectively, the "Service"). It describes what personal data we collect,
        how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.
      </p>

      <h2 id="api-scopes">3. Third-Party Platform Integrations &amp; API Scopes</h2>
      <p>
        Grapjes Maker integrates with third-party social media platforms using their official
        developer APIs. Currently, the Service integrates with <strong>TikTok</strong> and may
        integrate with additional platforms in the future. To use platform-related features you
        must log in with the respective platform account.
      </p>
      <p>For the <strong>TikTok</strong> integration we request the following API permissions (scopes):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><code>user.info.basic</code> — Login with TikTok:</strong> Used to authenticate
          you and retrieve your TikTok display name, profile picture URL, and unique open ID.
          This lets us personalise your experience and associate content with your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><code>video.upload</code> — Post Videos:</strong> Used to publish joke videos
          you create via the Service directly to your TikTok profile on your behalf.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Additional future TikTok scopes:</strong> Should we integrate further TikTok
          features, we may request additional scopes and will update this policy accordingly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For any <strong>additional platforms</strong> we integrate with in the future, we will
        list the relevant permissions and data accessed in an updated version of this policy
        before those integrations become active.
      </p>
      <p>
        We access third-party platform data strictly to deliver the functionality described above.
        We do not use platform API data for advertising profiling or sell it to third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data We Collect</h2>

      <h3>4.1 Data from Third-Party Platforms</h3>
      <p>
        Depending on which platform integrations you enable, we may collect the following
        categories of data from those platforms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Display name / username</strong> — your public profile name on the platform</li>
        <li><strong>Profile picture URL</strong> — your avatar as provided by the platform</li>
        <li><strong>Platform user ID</strong> — a pseudonymous identifier for your account on that platform</li>
        <li><strong>Content metadata</strong> — title, description, and publish status of content posted via the Service</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We only collect data that the platform makes available for the scopes you have authorised.</p>

      <h3>4.2 Data You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Joke content or text you create or customise within the Service</li>
        <li>Preferences and settings you configure</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.3 Automatically Collected Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Browser type and operating system (for compatibility and error diagnosis)</li>
        <li>Anonymised usage statistics (e.g., feature interaction counts)</li>
        <li>IP address (processed transiently for service requests; not persistently stored)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <p>We use the data we collect for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To authenticate you and maintain your session</li>
        <li>To display your platform profile information within the Service</li>
        <li>To publish content to connected platform accounts when you request it</li>
        <li>To remember your preferences and settings</li>
        <li>To diagnose and fix errors and improve Service stability</li>
        <li>To comply with our legal obligations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for automated profiling, targeted advertising,
        or any purpose unrelated to operating the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
      <p>For users in the European Economic Area (including the Netherlands), we process personal data on the following legal bases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR):</strong> Processing necessary to provide the Service you requested (authentication, content publishing).</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR):</strong> Anonymised usage analytics to maintain Service stability, where these interests are not overridden by your rights. We maintain a Legitimate Interests Assessment (LIA) documenting this balancing test, available on request.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance with legal obligations (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR):</strong> Where processing is required by Dutch or EU law.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR):</strong> Where we specifically request consent for optional features; you may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Data Sharing &amp; Third Parties</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share data with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Connected platforms (e.g., TikTok):</strong> Your data is transmitted to a platform's API solely to fulfil the actions you initiate (login, content upload). Each platform's own Privacy Policy governs their use of your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Trusted processors (e.g., cloud hosting) who are contractually bound to process data only on our instructions and in compliance with GDPR.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal authorities:</strong> Where required by Dutch law, court order, or to protect the rights and safety of others.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Data Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Your personal data is retained for as long as you actively use the Service. If you
        revoke a platform authorisation or request deletion of your data, we will delete the
        relevant platform-sourced data within <strong>30 days</strong>, except where retention
        is required by law (e.g., statutory accounting records).
      </p>
      <p>
        Anonymised usage statistics may be retained indefinitely as they cannot be used to
        identify you.
      </p>

      <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        The Service may use cloud infrastructure located outside the Netherlands or the European
        Economic Area. Where such transfers occur, we rely on European Commission-approved transfer
        mechanisms (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) to ensure an adequate level of protection.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Your Rights (GDPR Articles 15–22)</h2>
      <p>As an EU/EEA resident you have the following rights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right of access (Art. 15):</strong> Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to rectification (Art. 16):</strong> Ask us to correct inaccurate data.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to erasure (Art. 17):</strong> Request deletion of your personal data ("right to be forgotten").</li>
        <li><strong>Right to restriction (Art. 18):</strong> Ask us to restrict processing in certain circumstances.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to data portability (Art. 20):</strong> Receive your data in a structured, machine-readable format.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to object (Art. 21):</strong> Object to processing based on legitimate interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Right not to be subject to automated decision-making (Art. 22):</strong> We do not carry out solely automated decision-making with legal effects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additionally, you may <strong>revoke a platform authorisation</strong> at any time from
        that platform's own account settings. Revoking authorisation stops the Service from
        accessing your account on that platform going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        To exercise any of these rights, contact us at
        <a href="mailto:tempcenter@gmail.com">tempcenter@gmail.com</a>. We will respond within
        one month as required by GDPR. Where consent is the legal basis for processing, you may
        withdraw it at any time by contacting us at the same address; withdrawal is as straightforward
        as the original grant of consent and does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried
        out before withdrawal. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the
        Dutch supervisory authority, the
        <strong>Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens</strong> (<a href="https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl</a>).
      </p>

      <h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Grapjes Maker is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
        personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal
        data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:tempcenter@gmail.com">tempcenter@gmail.com</a>
        and we will promptly delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Security &amp; Breach Notification</h2>
      <p>
        We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data
        against unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of
        transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a risk to your rights and
        freedoms, we will notify the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens without undue delay and within 72
        hours of becoming aware, as required by GDPR Art. 33. Where the breach is likely to result
        in a high risk to your rights and freedoms, we will also notify you directly without undue
        delay, as required by GDPR Art. 34, using the contact details associated with your account
        or, where those are unavailable, a prominent notice on the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Cookies &amp; Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        The Grapjes Maker website uses no third-party advertising or tracking cookies. Any session
        storage used is strictly functional (e.g., keeping you logged in during a visit).
      </p>

      <h2>14. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes
        by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the Service
        after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
      </p>
