      <p class="meta">Last Updated: 25 February 2026 (rev. 2) &nbsp;·&nbsp; Governing Law: The Netherlands</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> Grapjes Maker collects only the minimum data needed to operate
        its features. We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties for marketing
        purposes. Data obtained from third-party platforms is used solely to provide the
        Service's core functionality.
      </div>

      <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Grapjes Maker ("we", "us", or "our") is a service operated under Dutch law. If you have
        any questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to exercise your data rights, please
        contact our Privacy Team at
        <a href="mailto:contacts@grapjesmaker.com">contacts@grapjesmaker.com</a>
        (subject line: <em>Privacy Request</em>).
      </p>

      <h2>2. Scope of This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Grapjes Maker website and associated
        services (collectively, the "Service"). It describes what personal data we collect,
        how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.
      </p>

      <h2 id="api-scopes">3. Third-Party Platform Integrations &amp; API Scopes</h2>
      <p>
        Grapjes Maker integrates with third-party social media platforms using their official
        developer APIs. Currently, the Service integrates with <strong>TikTok</strong> and may
        integrate with additional platforms in the future. To use platform-related features you
        must authenticate with the respective platform account.
      </p>

      <h3>3.1 TikTok API</h3>
      <p>
        When you connect your TikTok account, your browser communicates directly with TikTok's
        API servers. We request the following OAuth permissions (scopes):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><code>user.info.basic</code> — Login with TikTok:</strong> Used to authenticate
          you and retrieve your TikTok display name, profile picture URL, and unique Open ID.
          This lets us personalise your experience and associate published content with your
          account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><code>video.upload</code> — Post Videos:</strong> Used to publish joke videos
          you create via the Service directly to your TikTok profile on your behalf. Video data
          and metadata are transmitted directly to TikTok's upload API endpoint.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Additional future TikTok scopes:</strong> Should we integrate further TikTok
          features, we may request additional scopes and will update this policy before those
          features become active.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Data flow:</strong> When you log in via TikTok or publish a video, your credentials
        and content are sent directly to TikTok's API infrastructure. TikTok processes this data
        according to its own
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/privacy-policy/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>.
        We do not control TikTok's subsequent use of data transmitted to their servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data received from TikTok:</strong> In response to the scopes granted, TikTok
        returns to us: your TikTok Open ID (a pseudonymous identifier), your display name, and
        your profile picture URL. We do not receive your TikTok password, private messages, or
        financial information.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 Future Platform Integrations</h3>
      <p>
        For any additional platforms we integrate with in the future, we will list the relevant
        permissions, data received, and applicable third-party privacy policies in an updated
        version of this document before those integrations become active.
      </p>
      <p>
        We access third-party platform data strictly to deliver the functionality described above.
        We do not use platform API data for advertising profiling or sell it to third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data We Collect</h2>

      <h3>4.1 Data from Third-Party Platforms</h3>
      <p>
        Depending on which platform integrations you enable, we may collect the following
        categories of data from those platforms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Display name / username</strong> — your public profile name on the platform</li>
        <li><strong>Profile picture URL</strong> — your avatar as provided by the platform</li>
        <li><strong>Platform user ID</strong> — a pseudonymous identifier for your account on that platform</li>
        <li><strong>Content metadata</strong> — title, description, and publish status of content posted via the Service</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We only collect data that the platform makes available for the scopes you have authorised.</p>

      <h3>4.2 Data You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Joke content or text you create or customise within the Service</li>
        <li>Preferences and settings you configure</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.3 Automatically Collected Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Browser type and operating system (for compatibility and error diagnosis)</li>
        <li>Anonymised usage statistics (e.g., feature interaction counts)</li>
        <li>IP address (processed transiently for service delivery; <strong>not</strong> persistently stored or logged)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <p>We use the data we collect for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To authenticate you and maintain your session</li>
        <li>To display your platform profile information within the Service</li>
        <li>To publish content to connected platform accounts when you request it</li>
        <li>To remember your preferences and settings</li>
        <li>To diagnose and fix errors and improve Service stability</li>
        <li>To comply with our legal obligations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for automated profiling, targeted advertising,
        or any purpose unrelated to operating the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
      <p>For users in the European Economic Area (including the Netherlands), we process personal data on the following legal bases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR):</strong> Processing necessary to provide the Service you requested (authentication, content publishing).</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR):</strong> Anonymised usage analytics to maintain Service stability, where these interests are not overridden by your rights. We maintain a Legitimate Interests Assessment (LIA) documenting this balancing test, available on request.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance with legal obligations (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR):</strong> Where processing is required by Dutch or EU law.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR):</strong> Where we specifically request consent for optional features; you may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Data Sharing &amp; Third Parties</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share data with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>TikTok (data recipient &amp; independent controller):</strong> When you log in
          or upload a video, your authentication token and content are transmitted directly to
          TikTok's API servers located outside the EEA. TikTok processes this data as an
          independent data controller under its own
          <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/privacy-policy/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>.
          We are not responsible for TikTok's subsequent processing of your data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cloud hosting &amp; infrastructure providers:</strong> Trusted data processors
          (e.g., web hosting and CDN providers) who store and serve the Service on our behalf.
          These providers are contractually bound via Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) to process
          your data only on our documented instructions and in compliance with GDPR.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Error monitoring / analytics providers (if used):</strong> If we use third-party
          tools to monitor service stability, they receive only anonymised or pseudonymised
          technical data and are bound by DPAs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal authorities:</strong> Where required by Dutch or EU law, court order, or
          to protect the rights and safety of our users or others.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Data Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain each category of personal data only as long as necessary for its purpose:</p>
      <table class="retention-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Data category</th>
            <th>Retention period</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>TikTok display name, profile picture URL, Open ID</td>
            <td>Duration of active account; deleted within <strong>30 days</strong> of deletion request or authorization revocation</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Published content metadata (title, description, publish status)</td>
            <td>Up to <strong>90 days</strong> after publication, then deleted; or immediately on request</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>User preferences and settings</td>
            <td>Duration of active account; deleted within <strong>30 days</strong> of deletion request</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Browser type and operating system</td>
            <td>Transient — processed only during the active session, not persistently stored</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>IP address</td>
            <td>Transient — used only to route service requests, not logged or stored</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Anonymised usage statistics</td>
            <td>Indefinitely — these cannot be used to identify you</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        <strong>How to request deletion:</strong> Send an email to
        <a href="mailto:contacts@grapjesmaker.com">contacts@grapjesmaker.com</a> with the subject line
        <em>"Data Deletion Request"</em> and include your TikTok display name or Open ID so we
        can locate your records. We will confirm deletion within <strong>30 days</strong> of
        receipt, except where retention is required by law (e.g., statutory accounting records).
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also revoke the Service's TikTok authorization at any time from your
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/setting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok account settings</a>
        under <em>Privacy → Apps and websites</em>. Revoking authorization immediately stops
        the Service from accessing your TikTok account; we will delete the associated data
        within 30 days.
      </p>

      <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        The Service may use cloud infrastructure located outside the Netherlands or the European
        Economic Area. Where such transfers occur, we rely on European Commission-approved transfer
        mechanisms (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) to ensure an adequate level of protection.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Your Rights (GDPR Articles 15–22)</h2>
      <p>As an EU/EEA resident you have the following rights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right of access (Art. 15):</strong> Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to rectification (Art. 16):</strong> Ask us to correct inaccurate data.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to erasure (Art. 17):</strong> Request deletion of your personal data ("right to be forgotten").</li>
        <li><strong>Right to restriction (Art. 18):</strong> Ask us to restrict processing in certain circumstances.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to data portability (Art. 20):</strong> Receive your data in a structured, machine-readable format.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to object (Art. 21):</strong> Object to processing based on legitimate interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Right not to be subject to automated decision-making (Art. 22):</strong> We do not carry out solely automated decision-making with legal effects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additionally, you may <strong>revoke a platform authorisation</strong> at any time from
        that platform's own account settings. Revoking authorisation stops the Service from
        accessing your account on that platform going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        To exercise any of these rights, contact us at
        <a href="mailto:contacts@grapjesmaker.com">contacts@grapjesmaker.com</a>. We will respond within
        one month as required by GDPR. Where consent is the legal basis for processing, you may
        withdraw it at any time by contacting us at the same address; withdrawal is as straightforward
        as the original grant of consent and does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried
        out before withdrawal. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the
        Dutch supervisory authority, the
        <strong>Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens</strong> (<a href="https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl</a>).
      </p>

      <h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Grapjes Maker is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
        personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal
        data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contacts@grapjesmaker.com">contacts@grapjesmaker.com</a>
        and we will promptly delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Security &amp; Breach Notification</h2>
      <p>We implement the following technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption in transit:</strong> All communication between your browser and our servers uses TLS 1.2 or higher (HTTPS). Data transmitted to TikTok's API is likewise protected by TLS.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption at rest:</strong> Any personal data stored on our infrastructure is encrypted at rest using industry-standard algorithms (AES-256 or equivalent).</li>
        <li><strong>Access controls:</strong> Access to personal data is restricted to authorised personnel on a need-to-know basis, protected by strong authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal data collection:</strong> We collect only the data strictly necessary to operate the Service, reducing risk by design.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular reviews:</strong> We periodically review our security practices and update them in response to emerging threats.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot
        guarantee absolute security, but we are committed to promptly addressing any vulnerabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Breach notification:</strong> In the event of a personal data breach likely to result
        in a risk to your rights and freedoms, we will notify the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens without
        undue delay and within <strong>72 hours</strong> of becoming aware, as required by GDPR
        Art. 33. Where the breach is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and freedoms, we
        will also notify you directly without undue delay (GDPR Art. 34), using contact details
        associated with your account or, where unavailable, a prominent notice on the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Cookies &amp; Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        Grapjes Maker uses only strictly necessary cookies and browser storage. We do not use
        advertising cookies, cross-site tracking cookies, or analytics cookies that identify you
