      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or otherwise using the Grapjes Maker website and associated services
        (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Service
        ("Terms"). These Terms constitute a binding agreement between you and Grapjes Maker
        ("we", "us", or "our"), operated under the laws of <strong>The Netherlands</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Third-party platform policies:</strong> Where you use features of the Service
        that connect to a third-party platform (such as TikTok, YouTube, or Instagram), you also agree to be
        bound by that platform's Terms of Service, Developer Terms, Community Guidelines, and any
        other applicable policies. For TikTok, these include the
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/tos/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok Terms of Service</a>
        and the

        For YouTube, these include the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Terms of Service</a>,
        the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-tos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube API Services Terms of Service</a>,

        <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meta Platform Terms</a>,
        and the
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meta Terms of Service</a>.
        If there is any conflict between those platform policies and these Terms with respect to
        your use of that platform, the platform's own policies prevail.

      <p>
        If you are under the age of 13, you may not use the Service. If you are between 13 and
        18 years of age, you may only use the Service with the consent of a parent or legal guardian

      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>All activity that occurs via platform authorisations you have granted to the Service</li>

      <h3>5.5 Content Published via Platform APIs</h3>
      <p>
        Content you publish to TikTok, YouTube, or Instagram through the Service is subject to the respective
        platform's content moderation, copyright, and enforcement policies. We have no control over
        a platform's decisions to remove, restrict, or penalise content after it has been published.
        You are solely responsible for ensuring that any content you publish complies with each
        platform's rules and applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        For full details of what data is accessed when you connect a platform account, see our
        <a href="privacy-policy.html#api-scopes">Privacy Policy §3 (Third-Party Platform Integrations &amp; API Scopes)</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>6. User Content &amp; Responsibility</h2>

      <h3>6.1 Sole Responsibility for Published Content</h3>
      <p>
        You are <strong>solely and fully responsible</strong> for all content you create,
        customise, and publish through the Service, including content that was generated
        automatically or with AI assistance. The fact that the Service produced or suggested
        content does not transfer any responsibility to us for that content once you choose
        to publish it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before publishing any content to a third-party platform, you are responsible for
        ensuring that the content:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does not infringe any third-party intellectual property rights (copyright, trademark, trade dress, etc.)</li>
        <li>Does not violate any personality rights, rights of publicity, or privacy rights of any person</li>
        <li>Is not defamatory, discriminatory, harassing, or otherwise unlawful</li>
        <li>Complies with the destination platform's Community Guidelines and content policies</li>
        <li>Complies with all applicable Dutch, EU, and international laws</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6.2 AI-Generated Content</h3>
      <p>
        Some content offered by the Service may be generated using automated or AI-based methods.
        We make no warranty that such content is original, accurate, free of third-party rights
        claims, or appropriate for any particular audience or jurisdiction. You assume all risk
        associated with publishing AI-generated content and acknowledge that we are not liable for
        any claims, penalties, or losses arising from such content.
      </p>

      <h3>6.3 Third-Party Rights Infringement</h3>
      <p>
        We are not liable for any claims by third parties alleging infringement of their
        intellectual property, personality, or other rights arising from content you publish via
        the Service. If we receive a valid infringement notice relating to content you published,
        we may be required to cooperate with the relevant platform or legal authority and may
        provide them with information necessary to identify you as the publisher, to the extent
        required by applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All intellectual property rights in the Service — including the design, graphics, code,
        branding, and content created by us — are owned by or licensed to Grapjes Maker and protected
        under Dutch and international copyright law.
      </p>
      <p>
        You retain all rights to original content you create using the Service. By publishing
        content to a third-party platform through the Service, you grant that platform the licences
        described in its own Terms of Service; you do not grant Grapjes Maker any additional licence
        beyond what is strictly necessary to provide the publishing functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or exploit any part of the Service without our
        prior written consent.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided on an <strong>"AS IS"</strong> and <strong>"AS AVAILABLE"</strong>
        basis, without any warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited
        to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of viruses or
        other harmful components. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any
        joke content generated by the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by Dutch law, we disclaim all liability for any loss or damage
        arising from your use of, or inability to use, the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the AS IS disclaimer does not exclude any implied warranty of
        conformity that cannot lawfully be waived under Dutch law (Burgerlijk Wetboek Art. 7:17).
        In particular, the core functionality of publishing content to connected platform accounts
        carries an implied obligation to operate as described in these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Dutch law, Grapjes Maker and its operators shall
        not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including
        but not limited to loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your use of or inability to use the Service</li>
        <li>Any content posted or shared via the Service</li>
        <li>Unauthorised access to or alteration of your data</li>
        <li>Actions or inactions of any third-party platform or service provider</li>
        <li>Any other matter relating to the Service</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where liability cannot be fully excluded by law (including under mandatory Dutch consumer
        protection provisions), our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the
        12 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or €50, whichever is greater.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GDPR compensation:</strong> Nothing in this Section limits your right to seek
        compensation under GDPR Art. 82 for material or non-material damage resulting from an
        infringement of the GDPR by us as data controller or processor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in these Terms limits any mandatory right you have under Dutch or EU consumer
        protection law that cannot lawfully be excluded or restricted by contract.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Grapjes Maker and its operators from any claims,
        damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising
        out of your violation of these Terms, your use of the Service, or your infringement of any
        third-party rights.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service, including if we reasonably believe
        you have violated these Terms. Where reasonably practicable, we will provide you with advance
        notice and a brief description of the reason before termination takes effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may stop using the Service at any time and revoke any connected platform authorisations
        from within the respective platform's settings. Upon termination, sections that by their
        nature should survive (including User Content &amp; Responsibility, Intellectual Property,
        Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, and Governing Law) will continue
        to apply.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Your use of the Service is also governed by our
        <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated into these Terms by
        reference. Please review it carefully.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last Updated"
        date above. For material changes, we will provide at least 14 days' advance notice by
        displaying a prominent notice on the Service. Continued use of the Service after changes
        take effect constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Complaints, Governing Law &amp; Dispute Resolution</h2>

      <h3>14.1 Informal Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        Before initiating any formal proceedings, we invite you to contact us at
        <a href="mailto:contacts@grapjesmaker.com">contacts@grapjesmaker.com</a> (subject: <em>"Complaint"</em>)
        describing your complaint in detail. We will respond within <strong>14 calendar days</strong>
        with a proposed resolution. This step is optional and does not limit your right to bring a
        formal claim at any time.
      </p>

      <h3>14.2 Governing Law</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms and any disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with them (including
        non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed exclusively by the laws of
        <strong>The Netherlands</strong>, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
      </p>

      <h3>14.3 Jurisdiction</h3>
      <p>
        Subject to §14.4 below, both parties agree to submit to the <strong>exclusive jurisdiction
        of the competent courts of The Netherlands</strong> (with primary venue in Amsterdam) for
        any dispute arising under or relating to these Terms or the Service. If you are a consumer
        under Dutch law, you retain the right to bring proceedings in the courts of your country of
        residence within the EU.
      </p>

      <h3>14.4 Optional Arbitration</h3>
      <p>
        As an alternative to court proceedings, either party may elect to resolve any dispute
        exclusively by <strong>binding arbitration</strong> administered by the
        <a href="https://www.nmi-mediation.nl/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netherlands Mediation Institute (NMI)</a>
        or, by mutual written agreement, another recognised arbitration body. The arbitration shall
        be conducted in the English language, seated in The Netherlands, under the arbitration rules
        of the chosen body. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding. Consumer statutory
        rights under Dutch or EU law are not affected by this clause; consumers are never required
        to use arbitration.
      </p>

      <h3>14.5 EU Online Dispute Resolution</h3>

      <h2>15. Force Majeure</h2>
      <p>
        We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in providing the Service, or any feature
        that depends on a third-party platform API, where such failure or delay results from
        circumstances outside our reasonable control. These include, without limitation: third-party
        platform API changes, restrictions, or unavailability; internet or telecommunications
        outages; governmental or regulatory actions; or other events of force majeure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where a material platform feature becomes unavailable for an extended period, we will notify
        affected users as soon as reasonably practicable via the Service or by email.
      </p>

      <h2>16. Severability</h2>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
        competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
        The invalid provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.
      </p>

      <p>
        These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you
        and Grapjes Maker with respect to the Service and supersede all prior agreements,
        representations, or understandings.
